                    Hi there again! If you're here, you must want to learn a bit more about me. As you already know, I'm a software developer with a keen interest in the world of databases! My journey into programming began back in 2010 when I used to customize my Tumblr themes. It's funny how life takes unexpected turns—I never imagined I'd pursue this path academically, but it's a career I've grown to love, and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to study it!

                    In addition to coding, I find joy in several hobbies. One of my greatest passions is watching movies—I strive to enjoy at least one film daily, a commitment I uphold with enthusiasm <a href="https://letterboxd.com/loonita/" target="_blank">(My Letterbox)</a>. Additionally, I take great pleasure in unhurried strolls along the beach, particularly during sunset, where I indulge in the simple pleasure of holding a warm cup of coffee ♡

                    But undoubtedly, what brings me the greatest joy is the precious time spent in the company of my beloved cats, I adore their company, even if all they do is sleep all day or watch birds through the window. Their mere presence brings me daily comfort and happiness!
